                        <p>In this note, I've demonstrated how the mathematically rigorous treatment of observables with continuous spectra works.

                        <p>This paper discusses the mathematical differences between electric and magnetic <em>dipoles</em>. I starts with analyzing the necessity of their difference and then discuss the possibility of considering dipoles as <em>fundamental sources</em> of EM fields rather than electric monopoles and currents.</p>

                        <p>This paper was my attempt to formulate the probabilistic approach to classical mechanics before I get familiar with Liouville's theory; Therefore, I used a frustrating method similar to what is used for Fokker-Planck theory. Then, I derived Liouville's equation and analyzed its solution in different situations.</p>

                        <p>This is a paper written by <em>Jörn Dunkel & Stefan Hilbert</em> in 2013 which criticizes the usage of the so-called "negative temperature" states and suggest that the Gibbs entropy is the only reasonable (consistent) candidate for the statistical counterpart of the thermodynamical entropy. They show that this entropy, while equivalent to Boltzmann entropy at thermodynamic limit, forbids the presence of negative temperature states. </p>
                        <p>I've read this paper because i've always thought (and currently thinking!) that statistical mechanics is deeper than it appears (in standard courses) and is not investigated thoroughly as deserved (in contrast to, perhaps, QM, QFT, etc.).</p>

                        <p>This is a paper written by <em>E. T. Jaynes</em> in 1957 which argue that statistical mechanics is not actually a "physical theory" dependent on physical phenomena (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, etc.). In this paper, statistical mechanics is considered as "the best possible estimate we can make based on available information" as a statistical inference. If ergodicity is seen to be violated, we are given some "new information" which alters our "best possible estimate" about the system so doesn't contradict other perspectives. I personally prefer This perspective to the subject and enjoyed reading this paper.</a></p>
